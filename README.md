# Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment

## Introduction
This project contains scripts for generating a *tidy* data set from
the [provided data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
ectracted from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The tidy data is generated by:

  1. Merging both training and testing data sets.
  
  2. Merging the activity labels to the data set where they are on seperate files in the raw data set.
  
  3. Providing descriptive variable names for each column as a column header.
  
  4. Saving the data in the more accessible csv format.


## Files
This package contains the following files along with this README:

  * **CodeBook.md - ** This file contains a description of all the fields in the
  provided tidy data.
  
  * **run_analysis.R - ** This is the R script used to generate the tidy data
  from the provided raw data.


## Running the Script
To generate the tidy data set:

  1. Download this repository using `$ git clone https://github.com/owo/getdata-005_assessment.git`. Alternatively, download and extract the zip file of this project through the [GitHub page](https://github.com/owo/getdata-005_assessment).
  
  2. Download the raw data set from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
  and extract its contents in to the project directory (the extracted directory should be called `UCI HAR Dataset`).
  
  3. In a terminal, do `$ cd /path/to/getdata-005_assessment`.
  
  4. Then do `Rscript run_analysis.R`.
  
  5. This will generate a tidy data set called *tidy_data.csv* in the project directory.
